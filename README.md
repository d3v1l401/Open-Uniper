About Open Uniper

I just said "Hey let's see what XTRAP sends around the network" and so i reversed it and exported its cryptographic algorithm.
Uniper is the internal name of the algorithm, don't ask me why, i don't work for them...
This comes from an unknown version of XTRAP (I don't remember anymore!).
